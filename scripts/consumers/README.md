# Scripts: Consumers

You're supposed to create scripts that initiate your [Django STOMP](https://github.com/juntossomosmais/django-stomp/) consumers in this folder. Django-Q or any other tool you use for creating consumers should have its script here.

Look at [this project](https://github.com/juntossomosmais/alhambra/tree/4d3caa08ed2741d69201096be870081bf8d8ab43/scripts/consumers) for more tangible examples.

âš  When you create your script, don't forget applying `chmod +x` on it!
